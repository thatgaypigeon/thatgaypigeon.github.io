# About

## How I made it

Here is the list of tools I used to make this site and host it completely for free:

* [FreeDNS.org](https://freedns.org) - To obtain a free domain name (`pigeon.uk.to`).
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) - To host my files on GitHub and deploy them for free.
* [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) - A helpful tool to convert markdown (`.md`) files to HTML for the web. This means it's way easier to write content and maintain a custom and modular theme.
* [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) - A tool to build a static search engine for my site, as well as my other projects.

I also used these extra tools to help streamline the process:

* [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - A GitHub pre-commit tool to automate parts of the build and formatting process.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) & [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) - Tools for applying consistent code formatting.
  * As well as [black](https://github.com/psf/black), [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8), and [isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/) for formatting Python scripts.
* [nanoemoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/nanoemoji) - A tool from Google Fonts to help create custom colour fonts.
* [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator), [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org), & Jordan Myers' [toki pona translation tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jayyydyyy/english-tokipona-translator) - For helping out with some translation and localisation.

I used code or other things from these sources, too:

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - For some of the fonts used on this site.
* [OpenDyslexic](https://opendyslexic.org/) - For the OpenDyslexic font.

My [[wiki]] is hosted on [Miraheze](https://miraheze.org/) for free.

I write all my code using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and host it on [GitHub](https://github.com).

All other code, scripts, and plugins were written by me, except where noted. This includes the translation tool, user preferences, and styling / animations.
